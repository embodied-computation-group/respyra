Breathing Techniques: A Literature Review on Psychological and Physiological Effects
Introduction to Breathing Techniques Breathing exercises involve the conscious, active control over the timing, volume, and mechanics of respiration. The most prominent of these techniques is slow deep breathing (SDB), which typically involves breathing at a frequency of around 0.1 Hz, or approximately six breaths per minute (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021). SDB and its variants are widely used as complementary health approaches to manage conditions such as pain, hypertension, anxiety, and stress (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021). While the overarching goal of these exercises is to modulate the autonomic nervous system, distinct mechanical techniques yield different psychophysiological profiles.
Varieties of Breathing Techniques Research has systematically compared several distinct breathing techniques to understand their specific mechanisms:
• Pursed-Lips Breathing (PLB): Inspiration occurs through the nose, and expiration occurs through the mouth with pursed lips. This technique is frequently utilized in pulmonary rehabilitation (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021).
• Unilateral Nostril Breathing (UNB): Commonly used in yoga and meditation, this involves breathing exclusively through either the left (LUNB) or right (RUNB) nostril while manually occluding the other. This naturally increases airflow resistance (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021).
• Loaded Slow Deep Breathing (ITL): This technique combines SDB with an inspiratory threshold load (ITL), requiring the individual to exert extra diaphragmatic effort to open a valve during inspiration (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021).
• Paced Slow Breathing: A generalized SDB technique where inspiration and expiration are symmetrically elongated, such as inhaling for 6 seconds and exhaling for 6 seconds (Luo et al., 2025).
Physiological Effects The physiological impact of breathing techniques can be observed across the cardiovascular system and central neural oscillations.
Cardiovascular and Autonomic Modulation: A primary mechanism by which SDB operates is through the stimulation of arterial baroreceptors—mechanoreceptors located in the aortic arch and carotid sinus that detect blood pressure changes (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021). Slow breathing creates significant fluctuations in intrathoracic pressure, which in turn drives blood pressure variability (BPV). This variation stimulates baroreceptors, leading to decreased sympathetic output and increased cardiac vagal (parasympathetic) tone, ultimately lowering heart rate and blood pressure over the long term (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021).
Distinct techniques modulate this system differently. Loaded SDB maximizes mechanical intrathoracic pressure changes, resulting in the highest BPV and the greatest increases in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a marker of cardiac vagal activity (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021). PLB also increases baroreceptor stimulation and RSA, though to a lesser extent than loaded breathing, and is uniquely associated with a lower average systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to UNB (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021). Conversely, individuals practicing UNB tend to take in a lower tidal volume (shallower breaths) to mitigate the feeling of resistance, which may be physiologically beneficial for preventing hyperventilation during exercise, though it produces less cardiovascular variation than loaded SDB or PLB (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021). Furthermore, short-term paced slow breathing significantly decreases heart rate and increases time-domain and frequency-domain markers of parasympathetic activity (RMSSD and HF power) relative to fast-paced breathing (Luo et al., 2025).
Neural Oscillations and Brain State: Breathing heavily influences brain activity. The respiratory cycle acts as a modulator of neural oscillations, synchronizing activity across brain areas (Luo et al., 2025; Molle & Coste, 2022). EEG studies demonstrate that practicing slow-paced breathing increases absolute power across delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands, reflecting a state of synchronized cortical activation (Luo et al., 2025). Furthermore, the actual phase of respiration alters neural processing: inhalation enhances exteroceptive information processing (e.g., visuospatial attention) and dampens heartbeat strength via the baroreflex, whereas exhalation facilitates interoceptive attention and the conscious perception of internal signals (Molle & Coste, 2022).
Psychological and Emotional Effects The psychological outcomes of breathing techniques are heavily dependent on the specific method utilized. Slow-paced breathing serves as a powerful regulatory tool against anticipatory anxiety. When individuals are faced with uncertain, threatening future events, slow breathing significantly reduces self-reported feelings of negative valence and physiological arousal, mitigating the emotional intensification usually caused by uncertainty (Luo et al., 2025). At a neural level, when facing an uncertain threat, fast breathing induces high beta band power—a marker of cortical arousal and mental effort—whereas slow breathing actively suppresses this beta activity, physically reflecting a calmer cognitive state (Luo et al., 2025).
However, the mechanical parameters of the breath heavily dictate subjective comfort. PLB is generally rated as the most pleasant and calming technique, affording the practitioner the highest perceived sense of control (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021). In stark contrast, Loaded SDB—despite producing the most robust cardiovascular benefits—is rated as highly arousing, less pleasant, and induces a higher sensation of dyspnea (difficulty breathing) and a lower sense of control (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021).
In summary, while Loaded SDB may be optimal for maximizing baroreflex function in conditions like hypertension, techniques like PLB or symmetric paced SDB are vastly superior for achieving psychological relaxation and emotional regulation (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2025).

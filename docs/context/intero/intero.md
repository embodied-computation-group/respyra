**Interoception and the Respiratory Axis: A Literature Review**

**Introduction to Interoception: Definition and Meaning**
Interoception is the body-to-brain axis of sensation concerning the physiological condition of the internal body and its visceral organs, distinct from exteroception (perception of the external environment) and proprioception (perception of the body in space) (Garfinkel et al., 2015). Contemporary definitions frame interoception as the sensing, interpretation, and integration of signals originating from within the body across both conscious and unconscious levels of processing (Suksasilp & Garfinkel, 2022). This sensory process is increasingly recognized as a fundamental mechanism underlying emotional experience, cognitive function, and behavioral self-regulation (Banellis et al., 2026; Suksasilp & Garfinkel, 2022). Consequently, disruptions or miscommunications in the ability to accurately monitor and interpret bodily signals are deeply implicated in various psychiatric and psychosomatic conditions, most notably anxiety, depression, and panic disorders (Harrison et al., 2021; Suksasilp & Garfinkel, 2022).

**The Measurement of Interoception**
Historically, the assessment of interoception suffered from methodological inconsistencies, often conflating subjective beliefs about interoceptive aptitude with objective behavioral performance (Garfinkel et al., 2015). To resolve this, researchers established a multi-dimensional framework that distinguishes between distinct levels of interoceptive processing (Garfinkel et al., 2015). This foundational model separates three facets: interoceptive accuracy (objective behavioral performance on tasks, such as heartbeat counting or detection), interoceptive sensibility (self-reported beliefs and dispositional tendencies to focus on bodily sensations), and interoceptive awareness or insight (the metacognitive correspondence between a person's actual objective accuracy and their subjective confidence) (Garfinkel et al., 2015). 

Recent large-scale psychophysical studies have demonstrated that interoceptive sensitivity and precision are largely modality-specific; for instance, performance in cardiac tasks does not reliably correlate with performance in respiratory tasks (Banellis et al., 2026; Suksasilp & Garfinkel, 2022). The only dimension that appears to generalize across sensory modalities is metacognitive bias, or overall subjective confidence (Banellis et al., 2026).

**Focus on Respiratory Interoception (Respiroception)**
While the cardiac axis has dominated interoception research, respiratory interoception (respiroception) offers a uniquely important clinical and physiological modality because it is closely linked to affect and is amenable to direct conscious control (Nikolova et al., 2022). Sensations of restricted or unsatisfied breathing (dyspnea) are highly salient threat signals that are profoundly linked to the pathophysiology of panic disorder and anxiety (Harrison et al., 2021; Nikolova et al., 2022). 

Measuring respiroception relies on quantifying an individual's sensitivity to airway resistance (Nikolova et al., 2022). Tasks like the Filter Detection Task (FDT) measure interoceptive thresholds and metacognition by asking participants to detect the presence of clinical breathing filters added to an inspiratory circuit (Harrison et al., 2021). To improve stimulus granularity and accurately estimate perceptual precision, the Respiratory Resistance Sensitivity Task (RRST) was recently developed; it utilizes a computer-controlled, motorized apparatus and Bayesian adaptive psychophysics to deliver highly precise inspiratory resistive loads (Nikolova et al., 2022). Using such tools, research indicates that individuals with moderate trait anxiety demonstrate lower perceptual sensitivity (a higher threshold) to respiratory resistance alongside lower metacognitive confidence, highlighting a physical deficit in tracking respiratory changes (Harrison et al., 2021). 

**Implications: Predictive Coding, Anxiety, and Interventions**
The meaning of respiratory interoception is best understood through the lens of predictive processing, which posits that the brain continuously generates models of anticipated bodily states (Harrison et al., 2021; Suksasilp & Garfinkel, 2022). During dynamic respiratory learning tasks, predictions and prediction errors regarding upcoming breathing resistance elicit strong activity in the anterior insula, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) (Harrison et al., 2021). Notably, this anterior insular activity during respiratory prediction certainty is altered in individuals with heightened anxiety, suggesting that anxiety is rooted in a miscalibration of interoceptive threat prediction (Harrison et al., 2021). 

Because the respiratory axis is accessible to voluntary control, it serves as a powerful regulatory tool (Luo et al., 2025; Nikolova et al., 2022). Slow deep breathing (SDB) techniques—such as breathing around 6 breaths per minute or 0.1 Hz—directly manipulate interoceptive afferents, leading to increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), altered blood pressure variability, and enhanced baroreflex stimulation (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2025). Distinct SDB techniques yield varying effects; for instance, breathing against an inspiratory threshold load maximizes cardiovascular baroreceptor stimulation and blood pressure variability, while pursed-lips breathing maximizes feelings of pleasantness, calmness, and perceived control (Gholamrezaei et al., 2021). Furthermore, slow-paced breathing effectively mitigates both the physiological arousal and the negative subjective valence associated with anticipatory anxiety when individuals face uncertain future threats (Luo et al., 2025). Ultimately, respiroception is an active, dynamic bridge between homeostatic regulation and emotional wellbeing (Luo et al., 2025; Molle & Coste, 2022).
